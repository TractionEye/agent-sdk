# @tractioneye/agent-kit

Open-source toolkit for managing public trading strategies with AI agents on TON trading strategy marketplace.

The Agent Kit gives AI agents a complete set of tools for autonomously managing a public strategy: market data, trade execution, portfolio analytics, and performance tracking.

An agent can analyze the market and monitor the live portfolio structure of each token, including position size, value in TON/USD, profit, realized and unrealized PnL, initial position, and entry price.
It also has access to historical strategy data, including PnL/ROI, total win rate, trades per week, max drawdown, and total strategy balance in TON.

As a result, an AI agent becomes an autonomous manager of a public trading strategy, capable of trading at a professional level and competing with other agents and traders for retail investor capital.

## What's inside

> **The Agent Kit does not manage wallets or private keys.** All trade execution happens server-side on TractionEye infrastructure.

## Install

```bash
npm install github:TractionEye/TractionEye-Agent-kit
```

## Quick start

### 1. Get your Agent Token

1. Open [TractionEye](https://t.me/TractionEyeTestBot/app) in Telegram
2. Go to your strategy → **Edit Strategy**
3. Tap **Generate Token**
4. Copy the token — it will only be shown once

> **One token = one strategy.** To get a fresh token, tap **Regenerate** — the old token is immediately revoked.

### 2. Initialize the client

```ts
import { TractionEyeClient, createTractionEyeTools } from '@tractioneye/agent-sdk';

const client = await TractionEyeClient.create({
  agentToken: 'your-agent-token',
});

// For AI agents — get all 12 tools
const tools = createTractionEyeTools(client);
```

### 3. Start the daemon

The background daemon handles market screening and TP/SL monitoring between agent sessions.

```bash
# Fill in agentToken in ~/.tractioneye/config.json

# If working from a local clone:
npm run daemon:start    # requires pm2

# If installed as an npm dependency:
npx tsx node_modules/@tractioneye/agent-sdk/scripts/agent-daemon.ts
# Or with pm2:
pm2 start npx --name tractioneye-daemon -- tsx node_modules/@tractioneye/agent-sdk/scripts/agent-daemon.ts
```

---

## Agent Tools

`createTractionEyeTools(client)` returns 12 tools designed for LLM agents. Each tool has a description that tells the agent when and how to use it.

### Trading session flow

```
read_briefing → analyze_pool → buy_token → set_tp_sl → get_status
```

### Tool reference

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_briefing` | Get market candidates from multiple perspectives (volume, trending, activity, new), tagged by source, with top-lists by key metrics. **Call first** on every trading session. |
| `analyze_pool` | Deep-analyze a pool: OHLCV candles, trade history, whale wallet concentration. Call after briefing, before buying. |
| `buy_token` | Buy a token. Handles resolve → preview → validate → execute → poll internally. |
| `sell_token` | Sell a token (full or partial). Use `"all"` for amountNano to sell entire position. |
| `set_tp_sl` | Set Take Profit / Stop Loss. The daemon monitors prices 24/7 and auto-sells when triggered. |
| `update_screening_config` | Update screening criteria for the daemon's candidate selection. |
| `get_status` | Get strategy performance (PnL, win rate, drawdown) and portfolio in one call. |
| `screen_tokens` | Screen TON pools by criteria (liquidity, FDV, volume, price change, etc.). For ad-hoc use. |
| `find` | Find a token by symbol or search pools by keyword. |
| `get_token_price` | Get current USD price for a token. |
| `get_available_tokens` | List tokens available for trading in this strategy. |
| `get_simulation_results` | Get dry-run simulation results. Only available in simulation mode. |

## Trading Skill

The kit includes a trading skill file at `skills/trading.md` that defines agent behavior:

- **Session algorithm** — step-by-step: recall memory → briefing → deep analysis → buy → set TP/SL → save to memory → reflect
- **Self-learning** — agent researches trading approaches, tests them, records verified lessons back into the skill
- **Daily memory** — agent maintains continuity between cron sessions through structured memory
- **Cron integration** — the skill specifies the cron message that triggers the session algorithm

The skill is designed for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com) agents but the algorithm can be adapted for any agent framework.

---

## Background Daemon

The daemon runs as a persistent process (via pm2) and performs two functions:

### Market screening
- Fetches TON pools from 5 sources every 3 minutes (configurable): volume leaders, transaction leaders, trending (5m/1h), newly created
- Tags each pool by how it was discovered (e.g. `top_volume`, `trending_5m`, `new`) — pools found in multiple sources get multiple tags
- Excludes stablecoins (USDT, USDC, etc.) and junk pools (low liquidity, zero volume, unlocked liquidity)
- Applies agent screening criteria from `~/.tractioneye/config.json`
- Builds top-lists by volume, liquidity, FDV, transaction count, and price gainers (1h, 24h) via client-side sorting
- Writes `~/.tractioneye/briefing.json` with tagged candidates + top-lists + portfolio + strategy state
- **Automatically pauses screening while an agent session is active** (lock file expires after 5 minutes of inactivity) — gives the agent full GeckoTerminal API budget during trading sessions

### TP/SL monitoring
- Polls token prices continuously
- Auto-sells when Take Profit or Stop Loss triggers
- Notifies the agent via OpenClaw CLI with full trade details (token, prices, PnL, operationId)

### Daemon commands

```bash
npm run daemon           # run in foreground
npm run daemon:start     # start via pm2
npm run daemon:stop      # stop
npm run daemon:status    # check status
```

## Configuration

All configuration lives in `~/.tractioneye/config.json`:

```json
{
  "agentToken": "your-token",
  "sessionId": "openclaw-session-id",
  "openclawPath": "openclaw",
  "tpSl": {
    "defaults": {
      "takeProfitPercent": 25,
      "stopLossPercent": 8
    },
    "perToken": {}
  },
  "screening": {
    "intervalMs": 180000,
    "filter": {
      "minLiquidityUsd": 1000,
      "minVolume24hUsd": 500
    }
  }
}
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `agentToken` | Agent token from TractionEye strategy |
| `sessionId` | OpenClaw session ID for daemon → agent notifications |
| `openclawPath` | Path to OpenClaw CLI binary |

## Simulation Mode

```ts
const client = await TractionEyeClient.create({
  agentToken: 'your-token',
  dryRun: true,
});
```

In simulation mode:
- `executeTrade()` records virtual trades instead of real ones
- Portfolio reads come from the real backend (positions are not simulated)
- `getSimulationResults()` returns win rate, average PnL, and recommended parameters
- Use this to test strategies before committing real funds

## File Structure

```
~/.tractioneye/
├── config.json            ← Unified config (credentials, TP/SL, screening)
├── briefing.json          ← Market candidates + portfolio (written by daemon)
└── agent-session.lock     ← Session lock (written by agent, read by daemon)
```

---

## Rate Limits

GeckoTerminal API: ~30 req/min advertised, ~5-6 burst limit in practice (per IP). Daemon and agent run as separate processes but share one IP budget.

| Component | Budget | Usage |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Daemon (TP/SL) | ~2 req/min | Batch price polling (1 req per tick, all positions) |
| Daemon (screening) | ~1.7 req/min | 5 sources every 3 min (~10s with rate limiting) |
| Agent tools | on demand | `analyze_pool` = 2 req per candidate, queued via rate limiter |

The Agent Kit includes a built-in rate limiter with priority queues (Critical → High → Low), a burst bucket of 5 requests, and a minimum interval of 2 seconds between requests. On 429 errors, the client retries up to 3 times with 5-second incremental backoff.
